# Issue ? 
# I need to install a package via pip and save it at the same time in requirements.txt
# add this function to your .bashrc or .bash_profile 

function pipy() {
    echo $'\n'$1 >> requirements.txt; pip install $1
}

# then either reboot or do this with logging off

source ~/.bashrc 

# now use pipy command to install package and save it's name into requirements.txt like this :

pipy flask 


# To-Do this snippet handles one library at the time , work on making it for multi libs 
# Example :

pipy  flask  flask-wtf

# will read only flask
